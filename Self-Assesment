In working on this assignment, I've gained a deeper understanding of various fundamental and advanced programming concepts. First and foremost, I've gained a better understanding of how to read and interpret UML class diagrams, which was a valuable skill for comprehending complex class relationships and structures in larger projects. I've learned how to design and organize classes effectively, defining attributes and methods in accordance with Java conventions. This has not only honed my programming proficiency but also improved my ability to build well-structured code. Translating a spam classification algorithm into functional Java code was a significant learning experience and is still something I am not super comfortable with. Specifically, implementing logistic regression for spam classification provided me with insights into machine learning principles which are very new to me. I now have a better understanding of the practical application of algorithms in real-world software. The concept of composition was a pivotal lesson. I've discovered how to create more complex functionality by combining different classes through composition. This skill is essential for designing modular and extensible software systems. Inheritance was another key takeaway. I've gained a basic understanding of how to create subclass-parent class relationships, which allows for code reuse and extensibility. Additionally, method overriding within subclasses has become a powerful tool for customizing and extending functionality. Customizing the toString method to change the appearance of objects was a small yet difficult lesson in providing a better user experience. Working with a potential linked data structure furthered my understanding of data handling in more complex scenarios. I've also gained a better understanding of structural recursion, which is a technique that I can apply to solve a wide range of problems. One significant realization is that you can effectively test a class without having a main method within that class. Instead, by using the main method in another class, such as SpamOrNotSpam, I've learned how to test and validate my code's functionality. Overall, this assignment has been a huge learning journey. It's been a rewarding experience that has expanded my abilities and knowledge as a programmer and developer.
